description: Colombia’s coffee is world famous for its flavor and the unmistakeable mild but rich aroma that rises from every brew. That may explain why we’ve been exporting our coffee for almost 200 years and, for most of that time, it’s been our top export. There are many secrets to our success but our geography is undeniably one of them. Coffee grows best in volcanic soil, at altitudes of 1,200 to 1,800 meters, in places that are free of frost but receive around 80 inches of rain a year. Colombia ticks all those boxes.

There is no place in the world greater for sampling a world-beating cup of coffee than in the Colombian coffee district, where the bean grows. While a journey along the Colombian coffee route takes in many incredible cities, nothing beats the experience of relaxing on a traditional coffee farm.

Here you can learn about this famous crop, pick your own coffee cherries and inhale their delicious aroma before they’re roasted. Understanding the way the fruit is selected, and how farmers utilize the experience they have garnered through the generations, is living proof that coffee in Colombia is more than just a crop.

Coffee tasting is, of course, the highlight of any trip to a Colombian coffee farm. The country’s growers like to pamper their visitors with a variety of types of coffee to try, and enjoy explaining the different textures, origins, aromas and finishes. From the first mouthful, you’ll feel like a connoisseur – drinking the best coffee you’ve ever tasted.

Why is Colombian coffee one of the world’s best
Coffee comes to life in Colombia. Every cup has the capacity to delight our palettes with aromas that are sometimes sweet, sometimes sharp, but always with a caramel undertone. Simply raising a cup to our lips and taking a sip is enough to lift the spirits and, more often than not, bring friends and loved ones together.

Colombian coffee has many characteristics and much of its popularity and success is down to Colombia’s different altitudes and thermal floors, as well as its rich soils and perfect geographical positioning, all of which combine to produce a distinctive and delicious flavor.

You’ll notice a difference in taste depending where you go in Colombia, with the country’s different climates, altitudes and rainfall levels all leaving their mark. It’s worth visiting as many coffee destinations as possible, so you can pick your favorite bean and understand its origin story.
